# A little insight into Me
Hi Everyone, I am Shantimohan Elchuri. This README will give you a bit of information about me.

## My Passions
I am a graduate in Electronics & Communications Engineering. But transformed into a software engineer on job. I belong to an age when there was no internet, no facebook, and coding is done either on paper or on puch cards. Come a longway into exciting filed of mobile app developement. I started it with apps for Windows Phone, now targetting both Android and iOS using Xamarin technologies.
